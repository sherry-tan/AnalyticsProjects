This project involves exploratory analysis of red wine properties and how they influence
quality ratings.

The data set contains 1,599 red wines (Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine)
with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3
wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between
0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

This project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

Using R and data exploratory techniques, it was found that alcohol and volatile acidity were most likely to affect wine quality ratings.
