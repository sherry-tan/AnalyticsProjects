The NYC subway data set was analyzed to investigate the relationship between ridership and variables like weather, time and day of week. Python and data science techniques were used including data wrangling, applied statistics and machine learning. Tools used included numpy, pandas, ggplot and linear regression.

This project was completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.
