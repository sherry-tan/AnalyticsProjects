SUMMARY

This data visualization depicts that women and more affluent passengers (i.e. Pclass 1 /2 )
were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster. 

DESIGN

Initial
index1.html:
- Bar Charts were used as the variables are categorical. 
- Pclass was used on the x-axis as the baseline visualization with the count of passengers
survived or perished on the y-axis, with survival or death illustrated by different colors
- Measurement axis was used instead of percent axis for count as the relative lengths
of the colored bars would give an indication of the percentage survived/perished per class
- Percentage axis not used to avoid a misleading situation e.g. if there were only 1 female passenger in Pclass 2, who died, 
there would be a 100% 'Perished' bar of the same length as say, for 20 females in Pclass 3 where, 18 died and 2 lived.
Pclass 2 survival would be misrepresented.
- To show how the survival varied for different gender, I decided to use animations to change the visualization accordingly
- Other aesthetic design choices were to ensure that text was centered with adequately large font for easy reading, and a change 
of the default color schemes to something a little less pastel looking. 

index2.html:
- changed "PErished" to red
-Increased frame duration
- shifted legend closer to chart
- orphaned the legend so that it doesn't refresh with frames
- Increased size of storyboard labels
- changed color of visualization title
FEEDBACK
1) "Perished" Color encoding could be more eye-catching, e.g. red
	Frame duration is too short
	To shift position of legend so reader does not need to move between visualization and legend to interpret it. Or to annotate
	bars with "Perished" and "Survived"
	titles not distinguishable enough
