SUMMARY

This data visualization depicts the number of passengers who survived or perished in the 
Titanic disaster and illustrates that whether a passenger survived or not was dependent
on sex, passenger class and age.

DESIGN

Initial - 
- Objective was to show how survival was dependent on the key factors of
sex, Pclass and age
- I decided to use bar charts as these could clearly show the split of perished vs survived passengers
and most of the variables were categorical 
- To start with Pclass was used on the x-axis with counts of passengers on the y axis. This would be the baseline visualization
- I added animations to show how other factors like gender and age would affect number of survivors, in addition to Pclass
- changed the colors from the default for minimalism
- ensured that title text and graphic were both centred
- font sizes changed for comfortable viewing
- lengthened animation time as default was too short
- used numbers instead of percentage on y-axis to show the proportion of survivors vs dead. I felt it was important
to show how many passengers there were in each class, with the length of the colored bars indicating the proportion of those perished 
or survived. This would be more accurate than a percentage scale in which all bars would be scaled to 100% [In one case, I had a 100% perished bar
for <12 years old, female, and Pclass = 1, because there was only 1 person in this category, who died.
